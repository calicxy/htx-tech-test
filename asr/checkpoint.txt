BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
THEN WHY SHOULD THEY BE SURPRISED WHEN THEY SEE ONE
A YOUNG ARAB ALSO LOADED DOWN WITH BAGGAGE ENTERED AND GREETED THE ENGLISHMAN
I FELT THAT EVERYTHING I OWNED WOULD BE DESTROYED
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM
BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
ARE YOU SURE DIS IS CLAIRE
IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
THE TEACHER THOUGHT THAT HE TAUGHT HIMSELF ALL HE COULD
THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET
BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
GOT ANYTHING YOU ONLY HANGING
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT ME TO TELL VINCENT
ONE OF US IS GOING TO JAIL
TO ROURISH THE FALCON
THEES CONVENTION'S GOING TO COST PLENTY
COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
NEXT IN STELL AN EXTENSION THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ADD CUSTOM FIGHT AND COMMANDS
THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCONIST
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF DE SODIAC TO HER
THOUGH YOU WON'T BLAME HER
BUT THAT'S WHY YOU CREATED THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE THE BOY ANSWERED
DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
HE HAD SEEN THIS SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEAR BY
IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BITTER TEA
A GINTO THROW A ROCK
AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
MIGHT TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PRAMS
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
I WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER
IT WANT TO SEE THAT MAP COVERED BEFORE WE GET THROUGH
IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND SHE HAS URGED ME TO DO THE SAME
MINES IN THE DOOR
FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN SEE THE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES
YOU MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID IN CONTAST WITH KHIVS
OGOLVI WATCHED TILL WON AND THEN GAVE UP
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
HIS SPEECH ENDED IN STANDING OVATION
IN HER WAY SO AM I HE SAID
WHEN THE SUN SETS THE MAN WILL ONCE AGAIN SURRENDER THE ARMSH TO ME
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND
WE MUST BE GOOD
HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TEN ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO
NOT EVEN THE TRIBEL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
OUR GENERATOR HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY ULTRAHIGH FREQUENCY WAVES
HE NEEDED SOME ONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WALL
ALMOST EVERY ONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
THE REPORT WAS LARGELY SCATHING
NO ONE ATTACKS AN OASIS
WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND OBLL ET TOUCHED YOU IF YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
EXCUSE YOU FOR WHAT
YESTERDAY I WAITED FOREVER FOR THE SUBWAY TRAIN
I'LL GO RIGHT AFTER IT
JUST MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME ABOUT OMONDS
WHERE WAS HIS HORSE
IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
COMPILING THE LINNOX COLONEL CAN BE TIME CONSUMING
IF THAT GUY LAYS AN EGG
THE BRASS LAMD HAD BEEN DISTURBED
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
WHO DO YOU THINK WRITES THEM
ANARCHY OF UDOCH ABOUT IT
THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ORE FAR BEHIND THE STATE OF THE ART IN IMAGE LUSIFICATION
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE
JUDGE DEBORA SENT ME
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
IT LEFT A GREENY STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
THE HOMELESS SEEMED TO LIKE SOUP
AND FINALLY THE FALCON RETURNED WITH THEIR MEAL
TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED AND THE SHOUT BROUGHT MANY CUSTOMERS INTO THE CRYSTAL SHOP
HE DECONTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD
AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
LOOK AT THE POLICY I GAVE HIM
THEN I DON'T GET PAID
I GOT TWO GIANT BULKBITES ON MY RIGHT LEG FROM LAST NIGHT AND THEY HURT
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED IT THE ANSWER
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CHARGE THEM WITH
WHAT A BOSS ALL THAT
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD DONE THAT
IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
WE CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH ON US
YOU ARE FAR TOO VALLABLE
THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DON'T REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE
A HALF OF HELOT
HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
IT IS RECOMMENDED TO DRINK AT LEAST TWO LEADERS OF WATER A DAY
VIBRATIONS OF PEASE THELER CONTENT
THOMAS WENT TO WAR
THEY WERE IN AN IMMENSE SETTING SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SPEAKING A STRANGE LANGUAGE
TANGIER IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA
I'LL HANG IT UP
THERE IS A WAY OUT
I'M GOING WITH YOU THE BOY SAID
WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
I'LL TERR YOU IN A MINUTE
I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH A SALT OF DRIED UP LAKES
THAT'S WHY I WAS SENT DOWN HERE
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
HE HAD COME TO A TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM
WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
FOR SOME REASON WE WERE BLOCKED FROM ENTERING
THE THREAMING POOL WAS FULL OF CHLOREN
BUT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT
HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WORLD
SHERI FAILED HER VASAL AND LAUGHED
I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE BUILD BEYOND THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
AT OTHER TIMES AT A CRUISING MOMENT YOU MAKE IT EASIER FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN
ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
YOU CAN'T DESERT NOW
I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME
THEY'VE ARRACED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPERCOMPETER
HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NUS
USING SCRIP LOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SENSE I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
HE'S HOME COOKING DINNER
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE STANDARD DEVIATION
NOW THAT'S TOO MUCH
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
THE CEILING COLLAPSED INWARDS
FOR EXAMPLE I CAN SAY SCORE TEST WORD TO PRINT TEST WORD OR CAMEL TEST WORD TO PRINT TEST WORD
I AM A WOMAN OF THE DESERT SHE SAID AVERTING HER FACE
WE WANT TO SELL HENMADE CHUKA BOOTS IN THAT FOOD TRUOK
HE IS TALKING LIKE A CHILD
THE QUICKER THE BETTER
THEN YOU MARRIED HER
FEW PEOPLE REALIZE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP
FEW PEOPLE REALIZED THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
WHEN THE SUN SETS THE MEN WILL ONCE AGAIN SURRENDER THEIR ARMS TO ME
ITS LAURA END WAS STILL IMBEDDED
BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TROWED BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YE HAD TO SET OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND T
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
I'M HUNTING WITH MAFOLCAN THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED
IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MAN'S MOUTH THAT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST
AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
SO YOU KNOW ABOU LUP THE BOY SAID
THERE ARE RUMORS OF TRIVAL WARS HE TOLD THEM
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED AND THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
HE ONLY LOST THREE BUTTONS OFF HIS VEST
I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AFTER THE BOAT SAILS
THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
HE FELT WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE SENTRIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN BUILT
FADI MAN NE GORTY ABURNING HER EYES
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
NOHT LOBINY DID
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PROTEST
FEW PEOPLE REALIZED THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
ON THE VERY FIRST PAGE IT DESCRIBED A BURIAL CEREMONY
YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY MY FATHER WAS NO BUSINESS MAN
THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HAD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HIRED AWAY
WHAT BOAT ARE YOU SAILING ON
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ELEANOR
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
WORKED HARD JUST TO HAVE FOOD AND WATER LIKETE
WHAT A LOAD OF TRESH SARAH A PIND
REST WELL TO NIGHT AS IF YOU WERE A WARRIOR PREPARING FOR COMBAT
THE TEAN AGRS PUT ON RED HOODIES FOR THEIR ANNUAL TO BAGENRAM
LEARNED TO RECOGNISE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
BURLING CAN BE SO LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR
LAURA TOOK OUT A CIGARETTE AND PLACED IT IN HER MAP
THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT ITS DESTINY TO THE END
THE VISION VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT HAD SHAKEN HIM
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
CRUKS DON'T PAY TEXAS
THE OMENS A TOLD HIM SO
BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FADAMER
THE ARAB ACCEPTED THEM WITHOUT A WORD
BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EY WAS TIRED
WELCOME TO DAVE'S GUITAR SESSION
IS THAT DOP STILL OPEN
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TO
HE BELIEVED IN ALMENDS
ON TOP OF ALL THAT THE WEEDS KEEP GROWING AND THE GABBIT HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT
BOUGHT A LOVELY JAP
AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
THAT'S NOT SO BAD
HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY
HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEAR BY
FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
AND EVENTUALLY MAN WOOL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WOLL WANT AGAIN FLOURISH
THE OCHYMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS
WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
ANY DECENT EDITOR CAN SHOW YOU Y NUMBERS AND LET YOU JUMP TO SPECIFIC WAI
I'M GOING INTO THE DESERT THE MAN ANSWERED TURNING BACK TO HIS READING
IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOGS
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
MAYBE TO MORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
I WANT MY GARDEN TO BE FILLED WITH ROSES PETUNIAS AND PASSION FLOWERS
AND WE HAD A BINT
MISTER AND MISSUS NATE JOINED THE RED CROSS AND SEWED
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
JUST AS YOUR GRANDFATHER TAUGHT YOU
THE MORDO HAS EFFECTUALLY THREE FULLY CONNECTED LAIRS
HE SAW THAT FATIMA'S EYES WERE FILLED WITH TEARS
TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON
IT WAS VERY HALF A HAD O POCUTS
DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY
THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES
I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF HOT DESERT
MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE
THE SHOP WAS CLOSED ON MONDAY
HE FELT UNEASY AT THE MAN'S PRESENCE
LET'S HAVE YOUR STORY
IT WAS A BANDLE OF MONEY
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
IF YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT RECURSION IS READ THIS SENTENCE AGAIN
THE FHIEF WAS IN THERE THE OWNER BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF TEA
THEY ARE SO USED TO ME THAT THEY KNOW MY SCHEDULE HE MUTTERED
THE MON WAS IRRITATED
A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHALL NEVER FORGET ABOUT A SHEEP
IT'S PRACTICALLY UP THERE NOW
AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEM TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE
THE BOY TRIED TO READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE SAND
I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME
HE STUCK HIS HAND INTO THE POACH AND FELT AROUND FOR ONE OF THE STONES
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCES THAT IS TO SAY IN PUTS
YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED
WHERE SHE USED TO LIVE
AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TOO
HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DON AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
THE BOY WAS BECOMING NERVOUS
WHO IS YOUR FRIENND THE TRUTH ASKED
THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SKETTERED PINE TREE
BEFORE GONS WARIN VAINTED ARMIS HAD TO THROW BULLER AN HIS SHOULDER AND IF A BULLET PLUSHED YOU YOU'LL HAVE TO SEEK OUT UNDER WENIS FOR
MY SEVEN YEAR ESU MA GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
THEY PLAYED UETS TOGETHER
HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTISED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
SHE NEEDS TO GET HER TRANSCRIPTS AND PASSPELAT FIRST
WELL HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK AND EAT THESE HAWKS
THE ORANGE FRUIT IS NOT YET RIPENED
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN LEATHERLING
THE OLD MAN WORE A BREAST BLADE OF GOLD AND HE KNEW ABOUT MY PAST
IN AS A TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
THE FIRST BASEMAN DROPPED THE BALL
HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN RIMID WERE
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEAR BY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
IS IT FOR FURTHER AUTOMATIC PROCESSING
ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL
FROM THEN ON THE BOY ANDERSET HIS HEART
OF COURSE HE'S COMING BACK HERE
THEY ARE JUST A PILE OF STONES
I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME
THEN WHO ARE YOU
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED WELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DATREES AND INNUMERABLE GORTAN SPREAD IN ONE CON
OH BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE
THE PEAK OF THUS MOUNTAIN IS OVER TWO THOUSAND METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL
THE BOY WATCHED THE EXCHANGE WITH FASCINATION
IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION  JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS MON ES IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING
MY HONIS ATHE
HE DIDN'T WANT TO CRY WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE
LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
I'M DYING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE
BE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
OUR CLOTHES ARE DRY
THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNS ALL THINGS HE SAID
THE INVADERS CARRIED THE LAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
THEY WERE RELIEVED AND HAPPY
A PART OF ME IS ALSO TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TRAVEL AS MUCH ANY MORE
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES
A MONK DRESSED IN BLACK CAME TO THE GATES
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHING WAS STRANGE
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
THE HALF THE SHUG COLLUPS
SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TALK TO HIM
THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS ERENLY NOT VERY EXITING
WHAT'S THIS THE END OF THE EIGHT
AND THERE WERE GUNE'S ROCKS AND PLANTS THAT INSISTED ON LIVING WHERE A SURVIVAL SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
BECAUSE YOU'LL KNOW ITS DREAMS AND WISHES AND WILL KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM
I HAVE DISABLED SOME OF THE CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES BUT THEY ARE NOT GREAT OUT IN THIS LIST
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
YOU TOLD ME THAT
I'M GOING TO MISS ANNIE
HE PUT HIS HEAD CLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF COMEL SKIN
AND YOUR CAMELS WILL BRING YOU WEALTH AND POWER
WE ARE HAVING HABRUGUS
AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
THE SEA HAS LIVED ON IN THE SHELL BECAUSE THAT'S ITS DESTINY
MOIST SOIL IS GOOD FOR THE FLORA
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS YOUR DADASET AND THAT IT IS NIL
NOBODY'S GOING TO RUSH ME INTO ANYTHING
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
JUST WHAT IS TE LOW DOWN ON WILLIAMS
IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS THET'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHYMIST
THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METYA WRIGHTS STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
WON DAT THAT GET US
THE NIGHT WAS WONG AND I WAS THIRSTY
LOVE REQUIRED THEM TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED
ONE NIGHT THE FATHER HAD A DREAM
IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS ONE UP
HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
LET ME CARM YOUR HAIR
SOMETIMES SAILS CHARLES NORVAY TO HOLD BACG SERIMO
THERE WILL BE NO RED UPRISING
HER HEIGHT HELPED HER WITH HER FIGHTING
BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOR SHEEP
IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
THEN SUDDENLY THEY KNEEL AND DIE
GILTS ALWAYS HAVE A BETTER VIEW
WE ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THAT RIGHT NOW
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDDLING KIDS
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
HOW LONG IS IT
BUT MY HEART IS AGITATED THE VOICE
I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
WHERE YOU GOT HIM
THEN I DON'T GET PAID
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
HIS NEW FRIEND PUSHED THE OWNERS ASIDE AND PULLED THE BOY OUTSIDE WITH HIM
WHERE IS THE OLD GOLD
THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME
MY NAME IS MELCHUSEREK SAID THE OLD MAN
THEN YOU TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
THEN SUPPOSE YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY
SHE FEDIT ON THE SHALF AND DEITSTATE
SHE LIKES YOU WELL ENOUGH TO STICK AROU
THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID
OUR HEART ARE PECULAR HAMMITON FROM THE PIT
IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUE LOVE
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
ASKS ONOR OF DATSTON HOW MUCH IS WHAT GOES HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB
IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVOURABILITY BEGINNER'S LUCK
DO YOU WANT TO BANKRUPT THIS ADMINISTRATION
I AM JUST A MAN WHO WONDERS A DESERT AND KNOWS THE STARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
I DON'T MIND WARKING FROM HOME MOST OF THE TIME BUT I DO MISHAVING POOR WORKERS
HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF VIED LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
I'LL BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEEDLOS
HE IS ON MY FAM
SELYDBERB'S NEED CHANGING AGAIN
THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED WELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DAITRIES AND INNUMERABLE COLOURED TENTS SPREAD AMONG THEM
I LOCKED EYES WITH THE FISH IN THE TANK
GOODS ALWAYS HAVE A BET OF YIEW
SHE REVERSED THE CHARGES
I GOT TWO GIANT BUGBITES ON MY RIGHT LEG FROM LAST NIGHT AND THEY HURT
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME
SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
A CURRENT OF LOVE RUSHED FROM HIS HEART AND THE BOY BEGAN TO PRAY
SHE PRIED FOR AN HOUR
THE IMMENSE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS BEGAN TO TRAVEL BASTER
YOU CAN ONLY SPIT OUT SO MANY SEATS
THERE'S NO DANGER THE BOY SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT
THAT'S THE MAIN IDEA
SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARMED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
I HAVEN'T ANY WATCH
THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
WHATYMEL ALWAYS WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH
DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
SHE'S A FASTY LITTLE FERRET
PLEASE USE YOUR TURN SIGNAL
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO COME DOWN AND GET YOU
ARTIFICIAL NURAL NETWORKS CAN DO SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR
I FEEL GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME THAT WE HAVE SPENT TOGETHER
HE WANDERED FOR A WHILE KEEPING WITH DEAD PANTS ON THE OISY STIFFINSIDE
HE IS WATCHING THE OTHER DOOR
AND THE LEADER POSTED ARNED SANTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
PITA IS AN ITALIAN CLASSIC
ACTIVUSTS CLAIM THE PIPELINE THROUGH THE BALTIC SEAS LEAKING
A LITTLE LEMONGRASS SHOULD FRESHEN IT UP
YOU CAN'T BE THE WIND THE WIND SAID
IT WAS ELYTMA'S TEST
SHE PROBABLY WARKED IT OUT IN ADVANCE
WHEN HE IS AN OLD MAN HE IS GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA
THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNACCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
THE RISK IF YOU GET IN HERE AND RIDE
I WANT MY HUSBAND TO WANDER AS FREE AS THE WIND THAT SHAPES THE DUNES
SHE IS ACCUSED OF STEALING WATCH
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
A GHOSTLY FIGURE APPEARED
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF ARGUING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T EXIST
THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
BUT SHE IS GONE
I'VE CROSSED THESE SANDS MANY TIMES SAID ONE OF THE CAMEL DRIVERS ONE NIGHT
WITHOUT RESPONDING THE GUARD ENTERED THE TENT WHERE HE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS ALL EVIDENT TO ME
HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
THE DAY WAS HOT AND THE WINE WAS REFRESHING
THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SAUT
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
A WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD CREATE A CONCISE TABLE
AND ALSO BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD HE THOUGHT BY HIMSELF
DON'T YOU PUSH ME AROUND LIKE THAT
THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY
WE MUST BE GOOD
YOUARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE THAT HAS ALL THE ONSES
AND THE ODOUR OF THE ANIMALS BECAME A BOOK MORE TOLERABLE
HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING
THE HIGH HUMIDITY IS MAKING ME SWEAT
IT'S USUALLY CUSTOMARY TO BRING THE MONEY WITH YOU
I IMAGINE THIS WILL BE A SURPRISE TO SOME PEOPLE
WE'D BETTER FORGET IT
THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME THING
MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY SAID
WELL USUALLY I LEARN MORE FROM MY SHEEP THAN FROM BOOKS HE ANSWERED
ADAM AS A CROOK
EVERY DAY WAS THERE TO BE LIVED OR TO MARK ONE'S DEPARTURE FROM THIS WORLD
THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
AND I THOUGHT HAY I THOUGHT I'D BE WOVED TO BEART
IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN
HOW D'YOU THINK THE TABLE LOOKS
PUTTING A POOL UNDER THIS FLOOR WAS A GREAT IDEA
HE GOT UP ADJUSTED HIS CLOTHING AND PICKED UP HIS POUCH
I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF
TWO YEARS AGO WRITIN ON THIS PLOT I HAD A RECURREN DREAM TO
BACON PANCAKES AND MAPLE SYRUP IS A HEARTY START TO ANY DAY
I NEVER KNEW GRANDMA TO BE SO DETERMINED BEFORE
THE GENIES WERE THE SPIRITS OF GOOD AND EVIL
IT'S TRUE LIFE REALLY IS GENEROUS TO THOSE WHO PURSUE THEIR DESTINY THE BOY
ARE YOU GOING TO TALK OR WANT YOU
HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY LIKE THEM
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPERCOMPUTER
DUMBICAME HEAT OF THE DRAUGHTBOD
HE TOOK THE FOURTH PART AND HANDED IT TO THE MONK
MAC TUB THOUGHT THE BOY
EXACTLY ANSAID THE ALCHENIST
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
THE AIRPLANE ROSE GRACEFULLY INTO THE SKY
IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE'S QUICKLY GOING TO FORGET MY NAME HE THOUGHT
NOBODY WANTED TO DISCUSS HOW WE ALL ENDED UP TRAPPED IN A GIANT LUNCH BOX
NATURE KNOWS ME AS THE WISEST BEING IN CREATION THE SUN SAIT
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
I KNOW WHY I' WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLOCK HE TAL
AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SAYING
SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL HIM PROFESSOR DAVIS
HE REACHED OVER AND PICKED UP A SHELF ON THE GROUND
I CAN'T QUITE NI YOU
MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
BY NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE ID SPELL
SEND THOSE OTHER PEOPLE IN
THAT'S A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE
AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
MAYBE WEALL ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MULE
I WANT THOSE STAMPS
HE WAS JUST AND GOOD
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
WE CAN'T LEAVE GREK HERE
RATES AND CONFLICTS OF RESIANS ZERO POINTS
THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING
WITHOUT THE DATO SET THE ARTICLE IS USELESS
I HAVE SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
LAGUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
THE FARGE RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LESS TALK ABOUT IT
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
MY TEXT DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORMAL RANDOMACT OF KINDNESS
I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS THING
HE WAS LEARNING A LOT OF NEW THINGS
THE BOY TURNED TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL
HOW ARE THE WEIGHTS COMPUTED
HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
BUT THE KING OF SOLOM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL
THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
THE BOY LOOKED AROUND HIM AT THE DATE PALMS
AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES
MEANWHILE THE OLD MAN PERSISTED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
AND GOING OUT AND FIND THEM
I AM NON TRALCHMIS THE ALCHYMIST CONTINUED
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
I TOLD YOU THAT YOUR DREAM WAS A DIFFICULT ONE
DID YOU FIND IT
I WISH I COULD GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL
I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ALCHYMISTS THE WIND SAID
SHOOT THROUGH THE DESK
THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUN
THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ALBOWED ONE ANOTHER
WHY DON'T YOU FELLOWS GET YOUR OWN NEWS
THE CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE WAREHOUSE BALLS
I'LL TELL YOU WHY THEY DID IT
THE BONIFIER HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER LIE THE WAYS NOGETED
IT SEEMS OLD AND WISE
HELD ME SIGND THEM
IT ALWAYS GETS ME RIGHT HERE
THE VANIGIS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUS ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME THING
A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL WAS SHIVERED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF A CYLINDER
I NEVER SAW HER BEFORE
AN BUT A STILL TO BE ALONE WITH PONCIPLES
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
AND A THING IS TERRIFIC
HE FELT UNSAFE LIKE DURING HIS FIRST LESSON IN DRIVING SCHOOL
HE WAS MINSTLY EXCITED AT THE MEANS
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
WHAT ARE THESE THINGS HE ASKED
CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE
DO I KNOCK OR SOMETHING
BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR OLAMNAI OR POSPECTIVE STUDENTS
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
MONDAY MORNING AT FIVE O'CLOCK
YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY BABIES AS YOU LIKE
I'LL ALWAYS LET YOU DOWN
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING
THE BASKETBALL BOUNCED OF HIS SHIELD OF TITANIUM
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
THOU WIND HAS MANY LAMES
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
HAVE TRUSTED MORE THAN YOUR LOVE FOR FAKIMON
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG UT A PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING
SO THEN TRY HE SAY TO THE ENGLISHMAN
WHY DO YOU THINK I BROUGHT YOU HERE
UNTIL MY WING WENT BAD
AT THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
DID SHE SOLVE THE RIDDLE ALL BY HERSELF
IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
I HAVE LEARNED THINGS FROM THE SHEEP AND I HAVE LEARNED THINGS FROM CRYSTEL HE THOUGHT
JUST YOU AND I
EVEN THOUGH THE SHEEP DIDN'T TEACH ME TO SPEAK ARABIC
HOW SHOULD I KNOW
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE HEART DOES WHAT IT CAN THE ALCHEMIST SAID
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HUMY MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
CAN I HELP YOU ASKE DE MIND BEHINDE WENDEL
I'LL TALK TO YOU TO NIGHT
THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURIST PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
THE ENGLISHMEN HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY THES STORY
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
JUDGED DEBORAH SET ME
A MISSING PARROT IS CALLED A POLYGAN
THE MORNING COST IS NOT OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE OR HIDING CRIMINALS
THE WHOLE OFFICE WAS STRUCK BY A DEAFENING SILENCE
IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT
IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IPPROVE UPON IT
IN ANOTHER YEAR MAYBE I CAN HELP
SOMETIMES THE CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
DHAN SHE APPEELED HER BETAL WAIT THE WATER AND LEFT
IT WAS JUST RIPE ENOUGH TO EAT
I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOPS
WALKING ALONG IN SONGS HE HAD NO BOOTS
USING SCRIPT LOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
THE BOY PICKED UP HIS POUCH AND PUT IT WITH HIS OTHER THINGS
AM THE ONE DAT NOSE
BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOME DAY THE GIRL SAID
HE NEEDED SOME ONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY A WAR
I DON'T THINK THAT OF FOILO YOU
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH IS IMBEDDED IN THE GROUN
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH THE BOYTHOUGHTS RUEFULLY
AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM
THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED
THEY ARE NOT WORTH MUCH THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
WE'LL FIND YOU A HOTEL
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHERE IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
SHE DECIDED AGAINST IT
MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP
A GOD DOCTOR BULLSIPE
DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AND N ABANDONED CHURCH
I'VE BEEN ALL OVER TOWN
LIKE YO TITYOU
THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY
HE TOLD FITIM A THAT AT THEIR NEXT MEETING
ALL THINGS ARE ONE
THINK I'LL GO HOME AND SEE WHAT THE FAMILY IS DOING
THE NERBA CITY OF SUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
IN THOSE DAYS WATI PYLAT THE BABE HAD INIIDEO ESTIMONY
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
YOU ARE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT AN GOLD
YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME
BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON
I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE ME THERE IF YOU CAN
AH YOU SURE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
WHAT DID SHE SAY
THE REVIEW OF RELATED METHODS IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND INFORMATIVE
THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE
AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOME ONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
MECCA IS A LOT FURTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
THEY BECOME THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
THEY REMINDED HIM OF THE OLD MAN
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
THE PIXSAL PROBABILITIES ARE CONDITIONED ON THE MODEL STATE
THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FARTHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
IT DOESN'T MATTER HE SAID TO HIS SHEEP
HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS HE SPOKE OF THE PROPHET
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLAMOTS ATMOSPHERE IN OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FATURES
IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVOURABILITY BEGINNERS LACK
THE TREES SWAYED UNIFORMLY IN THE BREEZE
HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
ENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
I AM AN UNSUPERSTITIOUS ARAB IN A BELIEF IN OUR PROVERBS
IT'S EVEN HIGHER THAN THIS
THE BOY SAID NOTHING
RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
AND RUN RUDOLF RUN TO MY ROCKING PLANE
WHEN THE PAN HAD COOLED THE MONK AND THE BOY LOOKED AT IT DAZZLED
YOU'D BETTER GET YOUR FRIENDS
NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE BACK IN THAT SAME VILLAGE
I BELIEVE WHAT SHE SAID
THE OLD MAN LEAVED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP
YOU GAVE THEM EVERYTHING I HAD THE BOY SAID
THEY WERE DECIDED THAT MANAGEMENT SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS INCIDENT
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
I HAVEN'T ANY WATCH
IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
THAT BAKER HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT COMPLAINING THE THOUGHT
WHO'S ENGINEER THIS GETS AWAY
WHEN I FIRST REACHED THREE TO IT I THOUGHT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD WAS PERFECT
I'M PROUD OF YOU
YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
YOU'LL WEAKEN WHEN YOU SEE THAT LITTLE JESEVEL
THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP
AND THAT'S WHERE THE POWER OF LOVE COMES IN
HOWEVER THE ARTICLE IS WRITTEN POORLY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLY
THEY JUST WON'T LET ANYBODY TALK POLITICS TO THEM
BUT I'LL MAKE YOU AMERIA A BUSINESS PROPOSITION
NOT THAT I WAS LISTENING BUT I NOTICED THAT YOU SOUNDED REALLY STRESSED WHEN YOU WERE EXPLAINING THE SITUATION TO HIM
WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DONE HIS HEART LEAPT
AM SENDING ANUMBER AT BATH
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
HELP ME THE BOY SAID
I'LL TIKE CARE OF IT
HELP ME THE BOY SAID
THERE WERE JUST DROWING CODIED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBTURE TEXTS
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T ESEN EVEN WITHA
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO
I FOUND A LITTLE CRAB OF ABOUT TWENTY PAPLES SURRANDING THE HEUCAL
OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
THERE IS NO LETTER
HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
AFRAID IT MIGHT RAIN
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
I TURNED AND AS I DID SO THE SCREWN MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT
THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
ITS LOWER END WAS STILL IMBEDDED
NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MEN WARE SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBE OF WARS
THIS NUTRITION CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF SERE
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT
WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLAP
WHERE DID HE KEEVE HIS MONEY
YOU HAVE TOO CROSSED ME INTIRE SAHARO DESERT SAID THE YOUNG MAN
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGER BRED MAN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FOYAGE
AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGAGE
HIGE AS TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
IT WAS BUNCHED UP AND HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME
IT WAS AN ELEMENT OF HER SEXUALITY
IT'S PRACTICALLY UP THERE NOW
I WILL CALL THE POLICE
YOU'RE UNLUCKY TOO THE FAD HAROB SAID
THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAD OF WAR
HE PUT A SIGN OF THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEAR BY
NO I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD
THEN WHAT DOES SHE WANT WITH YOU
THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
PLEASE DON'T CRY
SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
THE SHEEP WILL GET USED TO MY NOT BEING THERE TOO THE BOY THOUGHT
THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED THE BOY'S HEART BECAME MORE AND MORE SILENT
AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
MAGGIE AND UNCLE KENNY SOLD WAR BONDS
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOR ME A CAMEL'S WHINNYING WAS NOTHING MORE THAN WHINNYING
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOSHAR HE SAID
HE'LL BE READ AT ONE TIME
FOOTPRINTS OF MUD AND CLAY WERE ON THE FLOOR
THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS ZEBOS HORS REN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LEAVE ME ALONE
EXACTLY ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
YOU WANTO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
ALL YO'VE GOT TO DO IS TALK TO HIM
IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT OF THE MONK
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY ETHICAL READING OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF
I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
I WOULD BURY IT IN THE GARDEN
CAN I SEE BLOOD ORGY OF THE LEATHER GIRLS AT A MOVIE HOUSE
THE BOD CONTINUED TO LEAST INTO HIS HEART AS HE CROSSED THE DESERT
I COULD JUST PUBLISH MY COAT BUT THAT WOULDN'T REVEAL ALL THE LITTLE LESSONS I LEARNED ALONG THE WAY
I HOPE SOME OF THE LINES MAKE YOU SMILE
THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
SHOW ME SOME GRATITUDE
PREFETCHING IS USED TO AVOID KESH MISZES
THE BOYS SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
BUT W YOU MAIN TELLIN ME WHO GOES OUT
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
FROM WHERE HE SAT HE COULD OBSERVE THE PLAZA
HE SPENT THE ENTIRE MORNING OBSERVING THE INFREQUENT COMINGS AND GOINGS IN THE STREET
A MONG TRESSED IN BLACK CAME TO THE GATE
AND ASK FOR A GLASS OF WINE FOR ME
THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
YOU HAVE ENOUGH GOLD TO BUY MANY SHEEP AND MANY CAMELS
THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
I WISHED I HAD A LIGHE TO SMOKE BY IT
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
NOW I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD
MY MOTHER JUST CALLED YOU
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE THE LAND AND SEE HOW THEY LIVE SAID HIS SON
IS A SIMPLE STORY
I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
THE THOM PEFONDE DOG TO WICK
BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
THE ENGLISHMAN VANISHED TOO GAN TO FIND THE ARCHEMIST
I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHIMIST SAID
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO GOVERED WITH SUN WINDING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
NOBODY KNEW WHO MALCOMB WAS
THE ITALIAN GOT HER WORDS MIXED UP
AND FIND OUT WHERE THE NEAREST TELEGRAPH OFFICE IS
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
OF COURSE THIS ONLY REDUCES THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM
THEN WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE HE HASN'T AT LEAST CALLED UP
I'M ALREADY USED TO THE WAY THINGS ARE
THE PROCESS OF INCRIPTING THE HASH VALUE OF A MASSARCH IS CALLED DETUTIL SIGNATURE
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
A TANEL LIKE A DUCI BRIO
IT'S TRUE LIFE REALLY IS GENEROUS TO THOSE WHO PURSUE THEIR DESTINY THE BOY THOUGHT
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
I WON'T SHUT UP
THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
I LOCKED ICE WITH A FISH IN A TANK
MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ALCHEMIST THE WIND SAID
YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
HE BEGAN TO DIG AT THE BASE OF THE SICANBOR
YOU'RE IN LUCK YOU TOO THE FAT ARAB SAID
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE
THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTIO
THE OLD MAN GAVE A SIGNAL AND EVERYONE STOOD
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME
CAMELS ARE TREACHEROUS THEY WALK THOUSANDS OF PACES AND NEVER SEEM TO TIRE
IF I DON'T VANGE IT I CAN ALWAYS GO HOME
THEN SUDDENLY THEY KNEEL AND DIE
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM
GOOD BAY SAID THE BOY
THAT WOMAN IS GOING TO BE ON THAT ROOF
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
IS THERE A MISSUS JOSHUA
THE HORIZON WAS TINKED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED
AND IT GOES FOR YOU TOO
SUDDENLY THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TIME IN A DAY BECAUSE SHE NO LONGER HAS TO SPEND HOURS COMMUTING
I CAN'T QUITE HEAR YOU
THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
NEVER GIVE UP
IHAVE GOT THROUGH THE BATITHEA
THE NEXT THING THE DOB WONES AS A WOMB
I'M AN OLD SUPERSTITIOUS ARAB AND I BELIEVE IN OUR PROVERBS
WHAT DID HE BUY A PAPER FOR
WILL YOU TRUST HIM THAT HE DOES IT RIGHT
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME UNDER ONE CONDITION
IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
YOUR DEA FRALID IN HIM
SOMEBODY'S THRYING THIS KIT
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST
THE FIRE BURNED THE FOX
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE
I AIN'T SEEN EM FOR A WEEK
WHEN DOING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WE HAVE TO FIND A SUITABLE TRADE OFF BETWEEN EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION
THEY FORGOT THAT LEED COPPER AND IRON HAVE THEIR OWN DESTINIES TO FULFIL
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SAD TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF WIDE
STADDY IN TROUBLE
RHAD IS AN ANTELOPE MY SON
IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERD WILL SEND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET AN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
I FEEL LIKE A BOOT LAKER
WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
THAT'S WHY I'M QUETTING
WHO IS YOUR FAVOURITE AUTHOR
OF COURSE WITH FEW MORDS UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
THEY HAVE POWERFUL FORCES ON BOTH SIDES AND THE WAR IS IMPORTANT TO BOTH ARMIES
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHERE I WAS TATTOOED
THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT FLAGS UP THERE NOW
IF A CIN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU WILL BE A HAPPY MAN
THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZED I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
THE ARTICLE SHOULD CONTAIN YOU ARE L WHERE THE DATA SET CAN BE DOWN LOADED
BUT HE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK
I'VE HANDLED A GOOD MANY BIG PROMOTIONS IN MY TIME
IT'S ONLY A FEW BOTS MUMBLED OVER YOU BY A JUDGE
WE HAD TO RUSH DOWN THE MINUTE IT HAPPENED
HOW MUCH IS YOUR EQUITY IN
WE CANNOT FORGET THAT FARCE
IF I HAD TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN A PEARAMENS
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
I WILL DO YOU LIKE IT
HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY
IF I TOLD YOU IT MIGHT NOT COME TRUE
BUT MAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DOONES SURROUNDING THUT ENCAMPMENT
IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO DO
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
THEN ONE DAY AS TA BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN
DIDN'T YOU TELL HER
HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTISED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED
THE BATTLES MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS EVEN YEARS
THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED
SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND
I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
THEI TINIEST IT EN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
IT'S USUALLY CUSTOMARY TO BRING THE MONEY WITH YOU
UPON RETURNING TO THE WISE MAN HE RELATED IN DETAIL EVERYTHING HE HAD SEEN
BUT HE APPEARED TO BE UNAWARE OF ANY DANGER
THAT WOMAN IS GOING TO BE ON THAT ROOF
THE FAMILIES WILL BE HERE SOON
EVERY ONE WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG KNOWS WHAT THAT DESTINY IS
I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR MOTHER ON YOU
TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DIS
THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
WHAT IS IT ABOUT
THE BOY BECAME FEARFUL THE OMENS TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WE KNOW THAT AND WE'RE USED TO IT
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
HE NEEDED SOME ONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
THE NEWS WAS CHILLIN TO SAY THE LEAST
AT THAT POINT THE OMENS WILL TELL YOU THAT YOUR TREASURE IS BURIED FOREVER
IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGH
THE DESERT WAS ONE TO SEA HE SAID
HE WANTED THEM TO BE A PARK OF ROR INHERITANCE
BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
HE APPEARED WITH THE FUSTARS OF EVENING
I DIDN'T KNOW SHEPHERDS KNEW HOW TO READ SAID A GIRL'S VOICE BEHIND HIM
AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIES
THEN SUDDENLY THEY KNEEL AND DIE
IAM NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHIMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSE MEN
I WANTED TO SLEEP A LITTLE LONGER HE THOUGHT
IT'S A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS NATURE AND THE WORLD
TURNING THE AIR CONDITIONING ON LEADS TO AN INCREASED FUEL CONSUMPTION
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
NOT UNTIL THE MOON WAS HIGH DID THE ALCHEMIST RIDE INTO VIEW
THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
I WISH T AT I HAD A LIFE TO SMOKE BY
IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERY ONE'S FREEDOM
I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
I WOULDN'T LIVE IN IT AS A GHOST
TELL YOUR HEART THAT THE FEAR OF SUFFERING IS WORSE THAN THE SUFFERING ITSELF
BUT THEY'RE SOMEBODY'S CHILDREN
AND THERE YE WERE INBAD
THE HYDROGEN GAS ESCAPED
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP A LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNRIGHT
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE THAT AND YOU'LL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS COUNCELLOR
TOO BAD I COULDN'T SEE THE SKY FIRST
THE OLD MAN LEAPED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN NAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
HE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE HANDLED IT BETTER HIMSELF
I WONDER WHAT'S KEEPING MOTHER
ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN
THAT'S WHY I FEEL I DESERVE PART OF WHAT YOU FIND
AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
GIVEN ONLY THE PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE THE PRIVATE ONE
IT'S STILASIS SAID A CAMEL DRIVER
WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
THEY NEED OF KILLING SID THE LAKE
AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM ANTO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK
HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DARCHESS AND TRAKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
WHY YOUVITE ME
THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE ABOUT TICKETS TO A FRICA
THE CARABAN MOONED TOWARDS THE EAST
HET WAS SEEN ODDLY IN THE MORNING ROSSING ROVER IS DRAN
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
BUT I AM GOING TO EACH IT THE BOY SAID
YOU RESENTED ME FROM THE FIRST MOMENT YOU SAW ME
THE SHEEP HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
AND SUCCO FOR IT
THIS WAS MY DESTINY NOT YOURS THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED
DARON NEVER SAW A BOTTLE TILL HE WAS SIX MONTHS OLD
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I'D BUILT TA SUPER COMPUTER
I MISSED YOU AND I COULDN'T CALL YOU BUT I TRIED
KET THE RIOT GEAR
HE CALLED TO THE BAA AND IT TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNE ARONDIN THE ENCAPMENT
LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOUR LEAF CLOVERS
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAS BEEN UNCOVERED
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
DEY SAY IT'S FAKE
THE BOY THOUGHT OF PHATIMA
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY
JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM
BUKE I'M YOUR SISTAR
FOLK IS NOT MY FAVOURITE MUSIC JONRA
NOBODY KNEW WHOM MALCOLME WAS
MUS METURUITS ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED
WE MISS YOU N MISSHAVING A FRIEND LIKE YOU AND I'M SO HAPPY THE JUTES YOU GOT TO CATCH UP
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY WHO PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BOOK WHICH WAS EMBELLED IN THE GROUND
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TEACH ME SOME OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW
EVERYONE LAUGHED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM
SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
WEARING HIS NEW SANDALS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS SILENTLY
THESE ARE NOT CAMELS
HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
HE BEGAN TO DIG AT THE BASE OF THE SYCAMOR
I TOLD YOU I CAN'T USE TO FALLON ANY MO
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPERCOMPUTER
YOU CAN GET AROUND VERY EASILY BY TRAIN WHICH IS A VERY RELAXING AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO TRAVEL
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
UPON RECHARNING TO THE WISE MAN HE RELATED IN DETAIL EVERYTHING HE HAD SEEN
YOU CAN DO A LOT JUST USING YOUR VOICE BUT THERE ARE STILL A FEW TIMES YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF REACHING FOR A MOUSE
HE POINT TO A TRAILO OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
MEICA IS A LOT FURTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
AS THEY WATCHED THE PLAN IT SEEMED TO GROW LARGER ONCE MORE
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD HAVE IT
BUT NOW I AM SAD AND ALONE
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
DON'T YOU KNOW ME
YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
I HAVE HAD THIS SHOP FOR THIRTY YEARS
GHARGEM I NO THINKS O
MY DOG GAVE A LIFE TO SAVE MY CHILD
DON'T TRY TO ENTER INTO THE LIFE OF THE OASIS
THE TREASURE IS AT THE PYRAMIDS THAT YOU ALREADY KNEW
I DON'T BLAME YOU
CURSE THE MOMENT I MET THAT OLD MAN HE THOUGHT
THE SOUL OF THE WORLD IS NOURISHED BY PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
THE EDWARD VELI I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PETEM  AN WAING ONE OF THEM THET
THE SNAKES LITTHERED TOWARD THE SHADED BOULDERS UNDER THE CLIFF
FROM HERE ON YOU BE ALONE THE ALCHEMISTS SAID
THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TUCKINGTON'S SUIT
AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TWO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCAMIST
I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAIN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOP
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TELL
HE WADN'T FARING MUCH BETHER
BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
DON'T YOU KNOW THERE ARE NINE JOPS WAITING FOR THIS GUY
NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN
MOM TOOK GRANDMA TO THE GARDEN CENTRE TO HEAR THE LATTER NAMES OF PLANTS
SANDA READ ALOUD THE STRANGE EXERT
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COM
THE CRIMINALS FONTED THE POLICE OF E SUSIN PRISONDA
AND IN THAT WAY DEMONTS PASSED
THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT THAT'S A CRAY
IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HE SALT OF DRIED UP LAKES
THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES
BY IS CERTAINTE SARTON AS
STARTING WITH HIS OWN
THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOP
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE
UTMOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION
THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY INTO THE DARK
BUT THEN I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
THEY HAVE A CHEAP SAUSAGE AND FRIES OF THE BRURIE TO MORROW
THEY ARE NOT MY SHEEP ANY MORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NASTALJAH
MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
THEY SEEMED TO LAUGH AT HIM AND HE LAUGHED BACK HIS HEART BURSTING WITH JOY
FLAZER TAG IS A GAME QUITE SIMILAR TO PAINTBALL
WHOOULD YOU SAY IT WAS
YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
AH DUN'T BELIEVE IT
BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
EVIDENTLY WHERE THE FLOOR SHOW
IT'S NOT I THE WIND SPOKE ABOUT
THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME
THE BOY DO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WO SAID
CAN YOU GET IN THIS DESK
ELI WON FIRST BRICE IN THE SPENNING COMPETITION
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IN THE CONFORDED THING DO YOU
BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
BUT THEY DON'T COUNT
ONLY CRIS COULDN'T WAIT QUITE AS LONG AS THE OTHERS
NOW I WANT YOU TO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT
I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
HOLD ON A MINNUTE
SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHOUTED THE BOY AS THE HORSEMAN RODE AWAY
HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIST
HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIED WITH DEGINITY
BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
AN L E D WAS INDICATING THE PROXIMITY DETECTOR WAS WORKING PROPERLY
THAT'S WHAT KILLED HIM
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOR MAY A CAMEL'S WHINNYING WAS NOTHING MORE THAN WHINNYING
YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME
I'M GOING TO THEM
THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRAGGED THE WINE ITA LAUGH
THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
WHAT'S THE WORLD'S GRATEST LIE THE BOY ASKED COMPLETELY SURPRISED
THEY DADN'T HAVE THE PRINTING PLACE IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY ARGUED
BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
THEADOSON WAS A BOAT AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VAZES
I'M GOING TO THEM
YOU'RE THE WOK OF THE WORLD
YOU SHOULD HAVE VALUATED IN A PERCEPTIAL EXPERIMENT
THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
BUT THAALTOMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKIN
HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERY ONE WHO PASSED
THAT'S ALL MARK EVER TALKS ABOUT
IT BROUGHT HIS HARD HINTO HIS MOUTH
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
HE LIVES AT THE AL FOUM OESIS HIS FRIEND HAD SAID
HEATHEN ENSHORREN'S BUSINESS
THEY DOR VARIED WARNINGS ABOUT PHIVIS AND BARBARIAN TRIBES
THEY WERE KNOWN AS TIUS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMAN AND THE EL DELLI
MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
FROM ZENON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISION
I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HATE S THE BOY
MULLB AT THESE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TAIM ANDE
DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
THAT IS AN ANTELOPE MY SON
I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
I DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'D NEVER HAD HAMBURGER ALPOR
BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
DID YOU WANT TO SEE HER ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT
SAYS FERACHE TO GO THE LINET
HE HAD FOUND WHAT HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DEAR
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL
BUT HORSES TIRED BIT BY BIT
THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE WAS SWINGING IN THE GALE
THERE HAS BEEN A ROBBERY AT THE BURGLER SHOP IN DOWNTOWN
SHE KEEPS SAYING THAT SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT MOVING BACK HOME BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S ENTIRELY TRUE
HE'S AFTER THE MONEY
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MEN WANTED TO TRAVEL TO
SO HOW WELL WE NAME OL THESE HURRICANES
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS RETAINING ON HIS BODY
LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL
SPEAK TO THE HAND THAT RODE ALL SAID THE SON
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
I WAS SITTING WITH MY BEST FRIEND WHEN HE ASKED ME HAY HANNAH CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOUR
HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
YOU WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE READING IT
WELL MON'S GONE KET SITTING AGAIN FOR THE WEEK AND IF YOU WANT TO COME OVER
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS NOT THE JETTING OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
ANOTHER PERSON WAS THERE TO HELP HIM TOWARD HIS DESTINY
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
THE MAN WIT WITH HAPPINESS
I HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE THE BOY SAID
HE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE MERCHANT TO AWAKEN AND OPEN THE SHOP
THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
YOU'VE GOT LEAPSIC ALL OVER YOUR MOUTH
MACHINE GUN FIRE AWOKE THE FUGITIVES AND SENT THEM INTO A FRENZY
ATHONDES ONE DAY IN OF FIELDS
I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHTS THADED TROUBLE WITH A HAZING SOUND
EVEN FROM A DISTANCE THEIR EYES CONVEYED THE STRENGTH OF THEIR SOUL
I NEED YOU TO PEA SPONTENEOUS HE HAS CATTED ME OUT YOUR DINGDING
WE BEAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THAT STORY
IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ROUND SIX O'CLOCK
IF HE MAKES A BUYING MISTAKE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM MUCH
USED TO HUNT RABBITS THERE MYSELF
THE GENIUS WERE THE SPIRIT OF GOOD IN EVIL
NO THE OCHEMIS AUNTERED
HE PUT HIS HAT CLOTHED IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMELS SKIN
IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
WE CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH FROM US
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GASH FLOAT
WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DUNE HIS HEART LEAPED
HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
THE LITTLE GIRL WANTED TO HAVE A BALLOON BUT WAS TOO SHY TO ASK
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID
YOUR HAIR RATHER URNY
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
OXYGEN IS IMPORTANT FOR US BUT SOME BACTERIOR DON'T NEED IT AT ALL
BEING MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD ISN'T NONSENSE
I'M JUST YOUR LITTLE RENT COLLECTOR
HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TO MORROW SAID THE OTHER TAKING THE MONEY
THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WILL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL
THE BOY APPROISED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHYMIS
SO USUALLY A KEY PRESS INSTEAD OF A CLICK IS USED
IT'S IN ALL THE AFTERNOON PAPERS
IF YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU'LL BE A HAPPY MAN
IT SCALLED A PRINCIPAL FAVORABILITY
YOU GOT THE MAYOR AND PULLMAN BACKED AGAINST THE WALL
BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND
WHAT A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY
AN WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALE EM HE INSISTED
BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD SLAPPED
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
I'M SENDING IT OVER WITH BETH
YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
THAT'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS IS SAID THE OLD MAN
THERE'S THE PROFESSOR NOW
I THINK IT'S ALL BAD BID HUNTING NOW I SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED E
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD DONE THAT
IT WAS MY FEAR OF FAILURE THAT FIRST KEPT ME FROM ATTEMPTING THE MASTER WORK
WE'RE REFAGIES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
THE LOAFERS AND GULF KERRIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE COLD MILKY SOCKEE SERVED IN A BOX
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU ALL MORNING HE SAID AS HE LED THE BOY OUTSIDE
WHY ARE YOU CARRYING MONEY ASKED THE TRIBESMAN WHEN HE HAD SEARCHED A BOY'S BED
YOU ALL KNOW ME
USING SCRIP LOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT TRIES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
IT IS THE MOST VALUABLE STAMP IN THE WORLD
ALWAYS HEAT THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
AND FOR WISE MEN GAUD DOES THE MATTLE THAT EVOLVE THE FURTHEST
THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY
AFTER ALL WHO DOESN'T WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND HE CHIEF GREAT HEIGHTS
GIVE MY ONLY VOR PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE A PRIVATE ONE
THE SHOP FOLK WERE STUCKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BELL ROOM WINDOW
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
THE TROUBLE WITH USING THIS FOR ALL ONSCREEN MOMENT IS THAT RECOGNITION ACCURACY ISN'T ALWAYS PERFECT
PODATOES ARE LESS PAYS SAVING TEORABLE AND CHIP THAN PASTA
SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
I HAD THE EVERY ONE HAS GARYBOOSY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
MOST MATERIALICS ARE MORE OR LESS ROUND
YOU GOT YOUR WATER MELON
THE BOY SMILED TO HIMSELF
AND THE FALCAN THAN NURASIOUS MAN
THE APPLES ARE IN THE BASKET NEAR THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT
SHE'S KIND AND SWEET AND CONSIDERATE
YOU WANT THE MUN
HE WAS JUST AND GOOD
YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED
THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TADDERS
PALM TREES GROWS TWICE AS BIG VEAR
YOU WILL TAKE FIFTY AND LIKE IT
SO WE THEIR HEARTS SPEAK MORE AND MORE SOFTLY
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SUFFASED WITH THE SWEET SCENT OF SMOKE
HE MADE US STAND AND WATCH EM PAINT FOR LIKE AN HOUR
NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK
HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOUTH
DID YOU EVER WALK INTO THIS OFFICE
I REMEMBER ALL I SAT ON THE TABLE DURING THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
HE BELIEVED IN OMENS
THE CHEMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
THE BOY WAS SUDDENLY HAPPY TO BE THERE AT THE WAREHOUSE
HESET AND NEWSPAPER OVREMAN
YOU KNOW I'D TELL YOU IF I HAD IT
ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SALATER'S ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
THEY REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE LARGE PLAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HOWLED
AND BECAUSE THAT CHIBS TEKERED WAR I WANED TO GO AWAY  SEEKING THOU KANST
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGIN ITS LUCK
WE RETURNED TO THE CEMETERY
THE DESERT WITH ITS ENDLESS MONOTONY PUT HIM TO DREAMING
LEMENTON THIME SHOULD GO WELL
THEY CAN HELP THEMSELVES
I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARRY BEUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
EVERYONE IS JUST STANDING BY THE BUILDING WAITING TO GET IN
THE OMENS HAVE BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
STRANGE IMAGES PASS THROUGH MY MIND
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
YOU ARE GOING TO RUN INTO THE GOVERNOR
I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
HE'S TRYING TO TRICK YOU AGAIN
IT'S A COLD SAID THE BOY A BIT IS POINTED
TELL YOUR HEART THAT THE FEAR OF SUFFERING IS WORSE THAN THE SUFFERING ITSELF
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A RALPH'S CHILD BEFORE
WHAT OLLAR HELD TO NIGHT
THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
HI'D BETTER SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO
YOUR DENIS CALLED YESTERDAY
DACK WAS HIS WORK
THE CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE WAREHOUSE BOSS
PANDRA READ ALOUD THIS STRANGE EXCERT
STANLEY FELT EXHILARATED
I JUST DON'T TRUST ANY ONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURG OR HELPER
I WON'T EVER TELL A SOUL
TELL THEM IT'S A SERIOUS CASE OF DELIRIUM
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FOR MYSELF
I JEST WANT TO DREAM ABIT MICCA
NEVER GIVE UP
THE PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
YET EACH FELL TO HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER
THE TWO MEN EXCHANGED SOME WORDS IN ARABIC AND THE BAR OWNER SEEMED IRRITATED
HE WHAT DOOUS EH
STOP TREATING ME LIKE A CHILD
RBUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
THEY DON'T SEE THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE
DESPAIR IS SOMETHING THAT HAUNTS US AT NIGHT
BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT A BRET DATE AND WENT FORWARD
TEAM FLOUR WILL MEET U AT POINT B WITH TEAM FAVE
YOU'LL BE THE COUNSILLOR OF THE OASIS
TURN UP THE VILLLOOM
HITTING THE DERIT AND ESCAPEKEYS I THINK
SHE COMES BY IT NATURALLY
DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PAN HANDLING AROUND HERE
HOW IS BAZILA GOING TO HANDLE AMBIGUITIES LIKE CUE AND CUE
THE CLOSER HE GOT TO THE REALIZATION OF HIS DREAM THE MORE DIFFICULT THINGS BECAME
I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID
THEY FORMED HEAT THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
WHO IS IT FROM
LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LAW OR FINDING A JOG
MUCH BETTER SAID THE OLD MAN
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
AINK ON A SQUEAL
EMEN
WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW
SEEMS LIKE IT HOT TO BE FIXIBLE IN SOFT WARE
MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALISE THEIR DESTINIES
I WILL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THE EXECUTION WAS CANCELLED
CERTAINLY IAM SURE I AM COMFORTABLE
THIS IS WHAT I WISHED FOR
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
THESE TROUSERS DON'T FIT VERY WELL
ALL THINGS ARE ONE
THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PASTE
I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
A HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
AND I'M GOING TO BE OLD THINGS
I KNEW THERE WAS SOME MISTAKE
WILL YOU GET CLOSE TO HIM
THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVALVED
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN THE SAND
DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND A GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS THAN ONCE
WALK IN THE GRASS AND MY BARE FEET
THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
IF WE SERVE TEA AND CRYSTAL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPAND
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESTINY

EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
THERE'S A CARAVAN LEAVING TO DAY FOR AL FALUME
VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TEMPT
THE HONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF A FEW SCATTERN PINE TREE
BEACON PANCAKES AND MAPLE SYRUP IS A HEARTY START DO ANY DEE
IT WAS JUST RIPE ENOUGH TO EAT
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
THE ELECTRICIAN LOOK PUZZLED
I BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE
SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND
THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FILST FALLING STY
WHERE IS THE TREASURE HE ASKED
IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
THEY ARE NOT MY SHIP ANY MORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTRALIA
THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET
HE HAD COME TO THE TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM
WHEN HE WAS IN HOSPITAL THE NURSE TOOK AN EXTRA PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS ARM
HE WANDERED FAREWELL KEEPING THE DEAD PALMS OF THE ISE'S WITHIN SIGHT
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
HITTING THE DILLY AND ESCAPEKEYS DID NOTHING
AND EVENTUALLY MAN WILL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET HIM EXAMINED
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN BAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF THE SORCERERS
DID YOU FINISH THE INTERVIEW
THEY HAVE THEIR EYES LEWED ON HIS FACE
SOMETHING TERRIBLE THIS HAPPENED TO ME
I HAD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BAKERY AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE
ONLY WE CALL THEM AGENTS
WHY THE SHOPS STOP AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
HOW THEY MANAGE TO IMPROVISE THAT SUCH SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
AND THETS AS THE POE OF LOVE COMES IN
THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GALL HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
HE WANTED TO SAY SO TO THE ARCHIMIST BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN
FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
EVEN ME I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF OTHER WOMEN SINCE I MET THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
SO WHAT IS SAIL HIM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM
MARIVE OF THE SUN ONE STA
THE DESERT DID NOT ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
JANIT ROGER DIED THREE MONTHS AGO
AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
WHAT WOULD USE HE TO GIVING THEM A JOINT INTEVIEW
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODDLES IN IT AND SO ON
HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID ABOUT OFFERING SOMETHING YOU DID NMAN HAVE YET
WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TO MORROW SAID THE HOUR TAKING THE MONEY
THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHYMISS HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GOT INTO BATTLE
HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEAR BY
MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED
BUT FINALLY HE AGREED THAT THE BOY WHO SPOKE BETTER RABIC THAN HE SHOULD DO SO
PEOPLELL SAY STRENDOUS THINGS SAID BORBISSO
LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HOLI CAME BACK LATE FROM THE OFFICE
I WANT ADULT THE WORTH OF YOU
THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS MACKSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS SATE ALCHEMIST
BENJAMIN WAS SNACKING ON STRIPS OF BACON
THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCULARY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DOEDN'T UNDERSTAND THEENNY OF IT
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
YOU MAY KISS MY HAND
I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DAT OF LIGHT
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS TO BE SINCERE
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
THE SUN SOARED ABOUTS IT AND DECIDED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY
THET THOU IT LIKE THERE BUT ALBIN
THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
AND SO DO I
THE SCALE MODEL OF THE ARCHITECT'S PLAN SAT AT THE CENTRE OF THE CONFERENCE ROOM
AND SHOULD DAY BE GARNISHED
WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGHT NOW THE BOY ASKED
MY KEYBOARD IS FILLED WITH DUST
HE SHOULD RESPECT TRADITION
THIS SMANTOTOMI MOVEMENT COSTS YOU FORTUNE
I THOUGHT THE INSCURING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED
IT'S A COD SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS
MISTER LEE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
THEY RAN TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
HOW DID YOU LEARN TO READ THE GIRL ASKED AT ONE POINT
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
YOU'VE HINTED IT OFTEN ENOUGH
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
YOU CAN'T STOP FOR A THING NOW
WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAKE HIM UP
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING
IT'S NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMAN
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GASPHLOTE
SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
THEN A MAN APPROACHED
JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE
I WENT TO STRETCHIN MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
BUT WHERE ARE THE HOUSES
ISN'T IT JUST BEAUTIFUL
THE CARAVAN WOULD BE VERY LUCKY TO REACH THE OASIS
I'LL JUST WATCH EM HE SAID TO HIMSELF
IT RATTLED MENACINGLY
THE BOY WANTED TO TAKE HER HAND
I HAD THERE EVERYONE HAS GARYBOOSY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPAY PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
THE SAME HAND THAT HAD BRANDIGHED TO THE SOLD NOW HELD A WHIG
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGN THE ENGLISHMAN
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY CLEANING HE SAID
JUST USE THE PHONE
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
I AM GOING WITH YOU THE BOY IS SAID
THE EMERALD TAMLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE CALL OF THE WORLD
AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPASSIENT
WHO AS THUS MAN
A SEMING TRANSPARENT OF LAY PROMOTED THE BETAVERSION OF ANENDRIED UP
MEANWHILE THE BOY TAUGHT ABOUT HIS TREASURE
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FOR MYSELF
SO HOW WILL WE NAME OISE'S HERRICANES
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE BLOCKING MY VIEW
MAYBE TO MORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
HE PICKED UP THE TWO STONES AND PUT THEM BACK IN HIS POUCH
OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
WHAT'S THAT OTHER PAPER GOING TO GIVE YOU
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
THE CATERPILLAR RESPONDED WITH A NOD
WHAT'LL I TELL HIM
THE SOB FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE ROPING THEIR BEDROOM WANDOWS
THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF WAKANCY
SOME MEN WERE SMOKING FROM A GIGANTIC PIPE THAT THEY PASSED FROM ONE DOOR FONE TO THE OTHER
BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
WE ARE GOING TO GLASCOW YE
I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO
DERA HIS TREASURE
A CURRENT OF LOVE RUSHED FROM HIS HEART AND THE BOY BEGAN TO PRAY
DISREGARD MY LAST STATEMENT
YOU'LL WATCH THEM AS THEY GROW DEMONSTRATING HOW THE WORLD IS ALWAYS CHANGING
THE ART FESTIVAL WAS A DISASTER
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN
HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING HIS GRANDFATHER HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT BUTTERFLIES WERE A GOOD OMEN
ANDTHAT NIGHT GEN NO WHY I'M HICKE NAY NOW
THE CAMEL DRIVERS EXCHANGED INFORMATION ABOUT WINDSTORMS AND TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE DESERT
THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED
THERE ARE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT HONOR
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
THA WOTNIS PRECIOUS MAGIPENT
IY WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND
AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
SOME OF THOSE WHOSE SITHES FLIGHT SAY A TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY SHE ISN'T HERE
BEFORE HIM WAS AN ENORMOUS WHITE HORSE REARING OVER HIM WITH A FRIGHTENING SCREAM
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMELL THE WORLD
WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO WIN
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
EVERYONE LOVED THEM AND UNDROYED THEM
THAT BRINGS YOUR GOOD LUCK FOR TEN YEARS
YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
AT THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT ATENA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL ITWATER
HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
ALL WHO WENT THERE WERE HAPPY AT HAVING DONE SO
SOME MEN MY SMOKING FROM GIGANTIC PIPES THAT THEY PASSED FROM WA TUESY ATE
ENDELASTRONG
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
WE'VE BEEN FED BOLOWNE SO LONG WE'RE GETTING USED TO IT
THEN WHO ARE YOU
GO BACK TO WASHWINGDA CARAVAN SAID
BASED ON THE OMENS OF THE PHRASENT
SHE REVERSED THE CHARGES
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING
HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES
LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
WHEN HE'S AN OLD MAN HE'S GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA
AND HE KNEW THAT EGYPT WAS AN EFRICA
THINGOGOHOME AND SEE THE FAMILY IS DURING
BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW
THE BOY WAS SHAKEN WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHIMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SIDRIL OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
TOWN WAS A CASE OF SERIOUS DELURIUM
DID YOU BRING THE CHRISTMAS READ
BUT YOU ARE A LITTLE GIRL
DO YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ME THE MERCHANT ASKED
THANKS FOR THE STORY AND GOOD LUCK ON YOUR HONEYMOON
ABOUT THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
DID YOU MAKE A SPEECH
AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
YOU'D BETTER START RIGHT NOW
NO ONE CAN BE FROM ANY PLACES THE BOY SAID
HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
YOU HAVE KILLED YOUR FAGON GAN AT ME
LATER WE SIMPLY LET LIFE PROCEED IN ITS OWN DIRECTION TOWARD ITS OWN FATE
THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN OF THEM WHO TOOK A BIT LONGER TO AWAKEN
GIVE ME MY ROBE
I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
I DON'T WANT MISSUS DOUGLAS
FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
A PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THIS
WHO DO YOU SAY IT WAS
I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES
SHORTY YOU LOOK JOY TROPPING IN THAT CHURSEA
WE'RE JUST TRAVEL US THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
ELIZABETH CHARLES IS DEAD
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT THESE THINGS COST OVER HERE
AIDING AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL
AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
BUT CHILDREN ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM WITHOUT FRIGHTENING THEM
IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
THE EMERALD TABLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
BUT THE BOY SAT DOWN AND WAITED
I DON'T SEE A THING
THE CARAVAN WOULD BE VERY LUCKY TO REACH THE OASIS
IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
A THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE THEY REACH OF FIND CALLIN TO MALDLSAN AN SO ALONE
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPEN
THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
THE INFIDELS HAD AN EVIL LOOK ABOUT THEM
HE STILL HAD SOME DOUBTS ABOUT THE DECISION HE HAD MADE
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
THE BOY HAD NOTICED THAT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS IRRITABLE AND MISSED HIS BOOKS
THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FATIMAR
MAYBE HE'LL GIVE US ONE
THE BOY OFFERED HIS BOTTLE HOPING THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE
WE OWED EVERYBODY IN TOWN
WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL CALLING OF ITS SURFACE
WHO YOU HOLTINK ALDON
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU HERE AT THIS OASIS FOR A LONG TIME
MY FRIEZA CONTAINS ENOUGH FOR A BANQUET
WHO ARE YOU HE HEARD A VOICE ASK HIM IN SPANISH
IT TURN OUT TO BE A BITTER TEA
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PRINTING PLASS IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY ARGUED
IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY
I USED TO LOOK AT THOSE WOMEN AND ENVY THEM THEIR HAPPINESS
I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH
BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
WE CAN'T LEAVE GRACK HERE
AND YOU CAN MEET US AT THE STATION
IT SAID THAT THE DARKEST HOUR OF THE NIGHT CAME JUST BEFORE THE DAWN
HOW LONG IS IT
HOW MANY TINES DEY WON A CALM
I DO THE BEST I CAN TO HELP
JANIPA'S MAKING OF THE NINE O'CLOCK TRAIN
HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINOR'S FOO
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
YOUR LUCK'S NOT WITH YOU NOW
THAT'S GOOD LANDY
IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
YOU GET OUT AHEAD QUICK
BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING I FORGOT TO PACK
AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATAMER ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
THESE HAVE DISPLACED I SOD ON THE MINEN
YOU SHOULD SEE THE ILIGI SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD A FIGHTING HE IS
HIS NAME WAS JOSEPH
EVERY ONE LOVED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO
IAM ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
THE ENGINES ROARED AS THE ROCKET LIFTED ITS PRECIOUS CARGO UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF OMEN SAID THE BOY
DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERED TO THE ALCHYMIST
MY AGREEMENT WITH YOU GENTLEMENSTANS
NICE OF YOU TO COME DOWN
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
THE TWO MEN HARIDBAK AND FOUND THE CYNINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
HE REMEMBERED THE SORLOWO
AND SO DO I
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENT WILL HAPPEN
STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
YOU DON'T THINK I'M IN TO TELL
NONE THE OCUMIST ANSWERED
BUT HE GROUNTED THE TRAVELLERS THREE DAYS
YOU GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO WASH THE DIPERS
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE LEFT
THE ENGLISHMEN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN ANY DANGER
I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
THE ALCHEMIST STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND BENT TO THE GROUND
WHAT A WONDERFUL WEATHER
HOW DO YOU STOP THIS THING
THE LATTER OF THE FOX RIGHT WITHOT LOOK AT
I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU HAVE LEARNED THROUGH A JOURNEY
THE ALCHEMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT HONOR
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
WHAT SHOULD WE GIVE HIM
BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
THEN I DON'T GET PAY
FORGET IT THERE'S NO SUCH THING
THE YOUNG ARAB TOOK OUT A BOOK AND BEGAN TO READ
SHE TOLD ME SHE FEELS HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC
LICARISH IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPEN
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
IT'SGIN APADASITY ON THE MAP
CHRISTOPHER WAS CONFUSED
WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR LAND AND SEE HOW THEY LIVE SAID HIS SON
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM
YOU HAD ME WORRIED
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
USE THE EXPORT COMMAND TO SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO
THIS IS FOR YOU
THERE'S THE PROFESSOR NOW
YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO
THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
WE MUST STAY HIDDEN
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK
HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO FALL IN
NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
IF YOU START YOUR EMALES WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPADIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE
WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DOONE HIS HEART LEAPT
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
FIRST HE HAD STUDIED ESPIRANTO THEN THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS AND NOW IT WAS ALCHEMY
THEY BOTH SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
SO WHEN I LOOK OVER YOUR SANDS I'M ALSO LOOKING AT HER
IT'S STILL SOPPING WET
HE SAID THAT EVERYTHING AS IS ON DESTINY
A LARGE PEA SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
SOMETHING OLDER THAN HUMANITY MORE ANCIENT THAN THE DESERT
MY SEVEN YEAR RESIMA GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
THRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT
YE WILL GET DONUTS AS A BONUS IF YOU TAKE A SELPHY WITH ME
AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
HOW LONG SINCE WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER
FROM HERON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
THEY WERE SUFFERING FROM HUNGER
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE YOU
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
I WISH THEY WERE RABBINS
HE FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE THE SUN WAS ALREADY HIGH
THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUD
YOU HAVE TO CROSS THE ENTIRE SAHARA DESERT SAID THE YOUNG MAN
THE FINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY WAS A BOOKKEEPER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
THEYR JUST A PILE OF STONES
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEAR
HOW DO YOU LIKE HER
LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND E LITTLE ROUND PLANETS
THE MEN OF THE DESERT WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WIND
I COULD HAVE HELPED HER
I MADE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
MINE OF HETS IT DOWN
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT COULD HAPPEN ONLY TO OTHERS NEVER TO ME
SOMETHING'S THE MATTER WITH DADDY
I KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE
WHY HID THE EVERY ONE HIS GARY BUSBY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
IF I AM ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
THERE'S NO DANGER THE BOYS SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT
WE'LL HAVE TO SATISFY THEM
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
HE STILL HAD SOME DOUBTS ABOUT THE DECISIONS HE HAD MADE
GIVE ME MY ROBE
HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
THEN IT BECAME A SIGNAL OF DANGER
LOOKING AT THE SUN HE CALCULATED THAT HE WOULD REACH TARIFA BEFORE MIDDAY
YOU KNOW I'D TELL YOU IF I HAD IT
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND IY WAS THIRSTY
THEY HAV THEIR EYES GLUED ON HIS FACE
WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY
IT WAS STARLIKE AND I EXPLAIN THE SCENES OF THE SAUDIAC TO HER
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN AK TO PERFORM A RENAM ACC OF PINDNESS
IF ONLY WE COULD SEE IT
AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED A PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN A COMMOTION IN THAT LOCKER ROOM
THE CAMEL DRIVERS EXCHANGED INFORMATION ABOUT WINDSTORMS AND TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE DESERT
HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
AND SEIZING THE BOY'S BAG THE ALCHEMIST GAVE THE GOLD COINS TO THE CHIEF
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
I AM HERE ANTHE BOY SAID
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SA
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
GAULS STAND FOR THE LETTER G IN THE NATO PONETIC ALPHABE
MAWIVIOF THE SUN ONE STAL
HE WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE MARKET
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AROUND HERE
I TOLD YOU THAT YOUR DREAM WAS A DIFFICULT ONE
BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXULTANT
THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HORRORS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PRAY
IT WAS RISING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY OUT OF THE CYLINDER
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
THE CARAVAN MOVED TOWARD THE EAST
LOVE IS THE FORCE THAT TRANSFORMS AND IMPROVES THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
HIRE SUPERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE NEEDS THREE DAYS ANSWERED THE ALCHYMIST
AS NICE AS BLAKES
ONE AFTEROON ONE OF HIS SAWINS FELL ER AND EDIPED THAT HERED DEAD
TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERS
AND YET NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAS EVER MET THE OLD KING
I JUST KNOW THAT THE TRADITION IS ALWAYS RIGHT
YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT AGEMI
MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
HE WAS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR
THE FURST LOF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET SULK ABOUT IT
WHAT DID HE DO WITH HER
ALMOST EVERY ONE HERE SPEAK SPANISH
THE CHILD SOAKED UP IN FORMATION LIKAS PONGE
I I WAS TERRIBLY WORRIED
THE ARIA WAS SWIRLING IN DUST SO ENTANCED THAT IT HID THE MEN FROM VIEW
STORM INCREASING OVER THE ROCKIES
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE BOUGHT A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
SHE WENT OVER TO MISTER CHERRETT'S HOUSE
HANG ON A SECOND
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
GET THE LOAD OF THIS
HE WANTED TO SAY SO TO THE ALCHIMIST BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN
SAOUL WAS INFURIATING THE OTHERS
YOU CAN STAY HERE
ONLY IT'LL BE A LOT EASIER WITH YOU
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
I WATCHED THE WEATHER FORECAST
THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT HONOUR
WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
BUT HE'S ON THE RIGHT TRACK
WE ARE PART OF THAT SOUL SO WE RARELY RECOGNISE THAT IT IS WORKING FOR US
A GARRI TREW DOWN
WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE
SINCE THEN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANOTHER ONE
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
WE'VE GOT TO PRODUCE A SHOW NOW
BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
THE ALARM WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
WHAT DO THEY WANT
WHAT ABOUT HIGGINS AGAINST BECHAN
HE'S OUT DUCK SHOOTING NOW
THEY WHISKED THEMSELVES INTO A FRENZY
THE ACCOMMODATION WAS A FORDABLE ANCOSI
TIRD AND DUST EVERYWHERE GIVE ME THE CREW
EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
THE ALCHEMIST TAUGHT THE BOY TO PLACE THE SHELL OVER HIS SEAL
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN
DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PIPO SLEEPING IN PEACE
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
THE BOY AND THE ENGLISHMEN HAD BOUGHT CAMELS AND CLIMBED UNCERTAINLY ON TO THEIR BACKS
THE HEAT LASTED UNTILL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
LET'S STOP THIS ANOTHER COMMANDER SAID
MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
OH I MYSELF HEAD NOTHINK OF THAT
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLELT
WHO'S DOWN THERE WITH YOU
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
I DO THE BEST I CAN TO HELP
IT'S NOT A BATTLE OF GOOD AGAINST EVIL
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SENT DOWN FOR
IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
BUT I'M GOING IN SEARCH OF MY TREASURE THE BOY SAID
SOMETHING OLDER THAN HUMANITY MORE ENCIME THAN ITHER
I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
THE SUN WAS VERY HOT THIS SUMMER
DON'T YOU LIKE HER
AS WAS MECCA FOR THE MERCHANT
WE ARE IN NO HURRY THE CHIEF ANSWERED
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU
DON'T FIGHT FIRE AT FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
SHE SAID SHE WAS SO EXHAUSTED AND UNHAPPY THAT SHE THOUGHT OF LEAVING AND SHE DID
GO AND SPEAK TO THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
IF I DON'T FIND IT I CAN ALWAYS GO HOME
THERE WASN'T MUCH IMPETUS TO FINISH OUR CHORES
THEY'VE FILLD THREE SACKS
IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE
THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY MOVED AROUND SO MUCH
THE ENGLISHMAN SAID NOTHING IF WE HAR AT ENTE VECOMTE
THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN READER'S EXPECTATIONS CREATED BY THE TEXT AND THE REAL BEHAVIOUR SHOULD BE RESOLVED
HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
THE ALCHYMIST ERACED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
FROM HEREON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR LUMNAI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
I DON'T KNOW THE DESERT THAT WELL YET
THE TRACK BED ON THIS LAPTOP MEANS CALIBRATING
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
HIS HEART SQUEEZED AS IF HIS CHEST HAD SUDDENLY COMPRESSED IT
IT'S GOINE TO PUT OUR CITY ON NO MAP
FROM ATOP ITS WALLS ONE CAN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AFRICA
LISTEN TO THAT MOB
LOTS OF PLACES SELL TEA AROUND HERE EMAGIN SAID
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER
BUT JUST BEFORE LUNCH TIME A BOY STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE SHOP
THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY THE STORY
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
THE MORNING POST IS NOT OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE OR HIDING CRIMINALS
SHE PROBABLY WORKED IT OUT IN ADVANCE
ABOUT TIME ONE OF YOU LUNKHEAD SAT IT
THIS IS FOR YOU
ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
WHAT'S WORT DINNER TO NIGHT
THE BOYS STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
THIS MAN'S GOING TO JUMP AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MOST FAMILIAR FEATURES
THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
I WANT MY BABY TO LOOK LIKE YOU
THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SORE
TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
IT WAS GLATRINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
WELL HE FOUR ABOT DEAD THE OLD MAN SAID
SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR WILL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
THE OMENS HAD BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL
AS I WASHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY
MYRIA WAS HILLING IN THUS SO INTLONSE THAT IT HID THE MOON FROM YOU
HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK NEIL ABOUT IT
THE THOB HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO RUTATE
WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE COLLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
AND I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC
HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
ONCE YOU GET INTO THE DESERT THERE'S NO GOING BACK SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
JEST TELL THEM MARGE SENT YOU
IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FORAINE COUNTRY
IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
NO BASELINES OR COMPARISON TO STATE OF THE ART IS PROVIDED
THEY WERE SPACED OUT AND ROSE THREE FEET APART
AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT RUMOR AND
IS THIS THE YEAR YOU CAN'T HEAR ON
HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
I AM GOING AWAY HE SAID
THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
BUT HIS HORROT WAS SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS
ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS WAS TO BE GETTING READY
NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
BUT THERE THEY SAW A CRYSTAL SHOP THAT OFFERED REFRESHING MINT TEA
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD YAT FIGHTIN IS
YOU'LL BE THE COUNSELLOR OF THE OASIS
SHALL I ANNOUNCE YOU
I HAD SAY OH THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
THIS REQUIRES A LITTLE THOUGHT HERE
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE ON THE SHAPE
SHE SUNG THE AIR
THE SPACE STATION ROCKED VIOLENTLY DUE TO THE INTENSE PRESSURE WAVES FROM THE AIRLOCK FAILURE
RELL VEDON TO VICU D'I RITNO DA WEYOSCE
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEA
FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
KEEPIN US A CHANCE PANTIT OFTEN BECAUSE EVERY HEALTHY PERSON HAS TWO OF THEM
SHE WILL ALSO ANNOUNCE THE THIRD PARTY'S CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM
A MONK DRESSED IN BLACK CAME TO THE GATES
COME ON IN THE OFFICE HERE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVETED AN HOUR
THE OLD MAN WEDOWN THE ROCK TO THE BOY
YOU GIVE THEM EVERYTHING I HAD THE BOY SAID
IF WHAT WAN FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTOR IT WILL NOW SPOIL
I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID
I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
IF HE MAKES A BUYING MISTAKE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM MUCH
THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
I THOUGHT THAT SOME DAY I'D BE RICH AND COULD GO TO MECCA
NOBODY'D EVER TELL YOU WHOEVER IT WAS BECAUSE THEY'D BE SCARED
DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE
I SAID GOOD NIGHT
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
TANGIER IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA
THERE'S WOMEN A ROCK HAR CHARKS DON'T BE SOOLED
AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST
YOU'LL BE THE COUNCILLOR OF THE OASES
HE HAD FOUND WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
TAKE YO SHIRTON
WOOK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
HINYA DRINK
HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD
THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GISERV FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS AND
ALMOST EVERY ONE HERE IS BEKING SPANISH
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GRAIN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED
THE LIST WAS FRIGHTENINGLY EXTENSIVE
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
I WANT MY BABY TO LUKE LIKE YOU
I WAS SCERED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGES AND SAND PITS
JUDGE MERNARTIN SLOW
EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
I'VE TRUST IT MORE IN YOUR LIFE FORPARTIN
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
THE MINER HAD ABANDONED EVERYTHING TO GO MINING FOR EMERALDS
HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
DRIGHT AGAIN
IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
IT'S GOING TO PUT OUR CITY ON THE MAP
THE CROW TILTED ITS HEAD AS IF IT WAS THINKING
THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
ON THUS HAVING TE BALGANA DESIRED TO MAKE GAMPA TE
THE SNAKE JEDDED VENOM
THE BOY WATCHED AS HIS COMPANION WENT TO HIS HORSE AND WITHDREW A SCIMITAR
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT OMENS THE BOY'S INTEREST WAS INCREASING BY THE MOMENTS
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
ABOUT HOW WEALTHY WOULD YOU SAY
HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
THE THREE FELL SILENT
DON'T THEY USUALLY KEEP THE GUN ON THE FLOOR
AMASACA FOR THIS COUNTRY
HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL
I LEFT MY FATHER MY MOTHER AND THE TOWN CASTLE BEHIND
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
ABOUT TIME ONE OF EULANCATS SAID IT
NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
WITH THIS KIND OF ORGANIZATION I FIND IT MUCH EASIER TO PRIRORITIZE WITHIN A CATEGORY
CON THIS MAN ARON IS HERE THISIYER
WHEN I'M EETING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
TO NIGHT WE GIVE YOU SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW AND DIFFERENT
THIS MAN'S GOING TO JIM AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
PARA SITAMAL SHOULD GET RID OF THAT FANE
THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMOURED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH THET TRANSVERSED STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FEDDEN FROM THE PARPET ROUND
IT WAS A USEFUL REMINDER TO COMPLETE THE TASK
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
I'VE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGH KNOW THE BOY ASKED
GO BACK TO WATCHIN THE CARAVAN HE SAID
HE FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE THE SUN WAS ALREADY HIGH
I HAD TO ACT QUICKLY THAT'S RIGHT JUMPDON
THE SWORD DIDN'T FALL
I WAITED ALL AFTERNOON AND EVENING HE SAID
THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGLUVY AND HENDERSEN HAD LEFT IT
BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOR SHAPE
ALL I SEE IS T BET THEM OFF
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBRED MEN ARE FORCED TO LAVE IN HOUSES MARE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL
THE BOY WAS TARTLED
I HOPE IT WORKS
THIS IS WHY ALCHIME EXISTS THE BOY SAID
I DON'T KNOW WHO ANYBODY IS ANY MORE
SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHTS OF THE MINE
YOU FIGHTED KAT
WE'VE CERTAINLY BEEN ON SOME SWEET JAMS
NEVER MIND DOLSGEIS
THE TERROR WAS PALPABLE
AM I TALKING TOO MUCH
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING BEFORE THOSE REPORTES GETBACK
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
JONATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARAPHA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE JUNE
ADVANCING SLOWLY THEY SURGED AMONG THE STORMS
CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW
IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED
EVERYTHING I SAY IS RIGHT
AMBLID OF A TAFFLAS SAN TE FLOI THAT MAN ANBI MY AFTER
WHENEVER HE COULD HE SOUGHT OUT A NEW ROAD TO TRAVEL
WHO'D YOU SAY WAS GOING TO GET EM
WHO DO YOU WANT
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
YOU'D BETTER TAKE IT EASY
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREEN BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
I THOUGHT THE AUNT SCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
ALGUS GO UPSTAIRS AND SENT IT OVER WITH A MESSENGER
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
IT WAS A SECOND OR THIRD TIME THEY TRIED
MAYBE NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS
AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
AND THEIR EYES SPOKE OF DEATH
THERE IS NOT A REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULD
MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
LIFE ATTRACTS LIFE THE OLCHIMIST ANSWERED
HAVE HER CALL ME BACK
WILL YOU HELP ME
DOWN AT THE OFFICE WE GET ALL THE HELP WE WANT
LET ME SPEAK TO HER
TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
THE CONQUERED HALF OF THE WORLD ON HER HERSES BACK
SHE HAD NO TEMPERATURE
THE ANGEL TOUCHED THE MAN'S SHOULDER AND THEY WERE BOTH PROJECTED FAR INTO THE FUTURE
SHE KNOWS IT TOO
HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
TANGIR IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA
AND I'D BETTER READ YOUR BOOKS SAID THE BOY
MY NAME IS BED DAVID
HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOONES
I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
AND THERE I SPOKE OF DEATH
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WEEL ENDS FOR WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
THE DROUGHT HIT WESTERN EUROPE
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
HE WAS TENSE AND UPSET BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE OLD MAN WAS RIGHT
CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW
WHY DARES OCEANS OF ROOM HERE
WHAT ABOUT THE BLUE ONE
TO SHOW YOU ONE OF LIFE'S SIMPLE LESSONS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
SARA CAN YOU READ ME
SHE TOLD ME TO WRITE A PLAY FOR TO NIGHT
I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
AFTER TWO HOURS HE RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHERE THE WISE MAN WAS
READING BETWEEN THE LINES REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING
THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO CALL
I JUST WANT A DREAM ABOUT MAICA
I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES
DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
AFTER WRITING A BUG REPORT ONE SHOULD REGULARLY CHECK IF SOME ONE RESPONDED
AND YOU MERRITHER
LIGHTHOUSES IN FOGGY WORLD
LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
I AIN'T GOINE A SQUEAL
WE CAN'T LEAVE GREG HERE
I MIS CARED BUT WAITE NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PINTS
I AM JUST A MAN FOR WANDERERS IS A DESERT AND KNOWS THE STARS SADES ALCHEMISTS
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
BE SURE YOU SPELLED THE NAME RIGHT
I MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A SNAKE
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IND TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
THE TRAIN LINES PROVIDED AN EASY PATH TO FOLLOW
I FELT A CHILL DOWN MY SPINE
IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINENESS
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALK BACK TO MY HOME E MA BORY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPY
YO HONO HATELES OUTSIDE
THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
WHAT SHE GET AS
EXCUSE ME NEDIS MIIS NOT A LOWEDANTIS PART OF THE BEACH
I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
THENK I'LL GO HOME AND SEE WHAT THE FAMILY IS DOING
SINCE THEN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANOTHER ONE
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION THE DISTANCE CAME THE SCEND OF TREMS RINGING AND RUMBLING
PLEASE BRING MAMMA BACK
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME TING
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
MAY I GO AND SEE HIM
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
THEY WERE RELIEVED AND HAPPY
THE PRIEST COLLAPSED BACKWARDS
THE LAVANDER INCREASED IN INDAN CITY
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRENCH
I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
I AM ALREADY USED TO THE WAY THINGS ARE
ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
WE ARE IN NO HURRY THE CHIEF ANSWER
COURCH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT
DON'T TRY TO MOVE
ISN'T THIS A PAROMETER OF THE METHOD
HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURNED TO HIS MEDITATION
WHICH ONE OF THESE MEN IS IT
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID
I DO THE BEST I CAN TO HELP
THEN WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORTS OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
WE ALWAYS OBSERBED THE TRADITION
I HAVE KNOWN TRUE ARCHIMISTS DARCHIMIST CONTINUED
WHAT'LL IT TAKE TILL THE BANK REOPENS
SHE NEEDS TO GET HER TRANSCRIPTS AND PASSPORT FIRST
DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE HERE WHO CURES PEOPLE'S ILLNESSES THE BOY ASKED
MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
FOR A MOMENT EVERYTHING WAS DARK AND SCARY
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOR ME A CAMEL'S WHINNYING WAS NOTHING MORE THAN WINNING
IT WAS TARM BETWEEN FEAR AND CURIOSITY
THE TALK WAS SO DRATEFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FON
SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE RIVER
WHEN YOU ARE LOVED YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN CREATION
ALBERT DIDN'T HAVE A BROTHER
I'M A DESERT WOMAN AND I'M PROUD OF THAT
HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
AND YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO
WITH THE WARS BETWEEN THE TRIBES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE DESERT
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES AND TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
IN ANY CASE THE DESERT WAS IMPASSABLE
YOU COULD HAVE DIED AFTER PEACE HAD BEEN DECLARED
THEY FORGET THAT LEAD COPPER AND IRON HAVE THEIR OWN DESTINIES TO FULFIL
I'M HERE THE BOY SAID
NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL RICH
NO HE RUS SIXTY DAYS ONDES
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
HE BROUGHT SIX SHEEP WITH HIM
THE LAVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
ONLY REALIZED THAT HAD BEEN DESTRUCTIVE FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
IF I HAD TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE PYRAMIDS
HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN SAID BUT OFFERING SOMETHING HE DIDN'T HAVEN A HAVE YET
ITS CANDIS NOW ON LONG DISTANCE FROM WASHINGTON
EVEN THE GUIDES SPOKE VERY LITTLE TO ONE ANOTHER
IT'S A SIMPLE STORY
SHE'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND
ED CONSURUS THEIR HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AT TIME
THEY ENJOYED THE SILENCE
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PET
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SOON BE HAPPENING
HE WON'T LEAVE THE CIRCLE
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FILLED WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
MY TEXTNA LOFE PAY FOR THE OF ITS SCHOOL PROBLES
A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELLERS
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
WHERE'S THE OLD GOULD
THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY
WE ARE JUST TRAVELERS THE ICAMIST ANSWERED
HIGH AS TWO PERSONAL TRAIN IS AND MAKES ONE OF THEM TRAIN YELLOW ONE
I AM SURPRISED THE BOY SAID
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG
AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINOLS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROOV
YOU'D BETTER START RIGHT NOW
IT MEANS MY JOB
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS MEW FRIEND
THET GOINTO BE GENTLE TO SIDME
HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
HE HAD NOT A SCENT IN HIS POCKET BUT HE HAD FATE
HE THOUGHT THAT WITH SOME PATIENCE HE HAD BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM EVERY THING INTO GOWD
THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETELIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO
IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
DE MONEY IS UNEMPORTANT
THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGED TO GET HIM OUT OF THE PARK
HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS O LONDON
HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF A GAG
YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
DOTRIBALD CHEFTAINE CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
NEXT TIME WE'RE GOING TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY
IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT THAT'S GREAT NOW ONE
BUT MEN BEGAN TO REJECT SIMPLE THINGS AND TO WRITE TRACTS INTERPRETATIONS AND PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
PEOPLE SAW ME COMING AND WELCOMED ME HE SOUGHED
I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
THE FINK ITSELF AS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
VENUS IS FAR TOO HOT FOR EXPLORATION
OGLFI TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE'D SEEN
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
THIS PUTS ME IN A PECULIAR HOLE
AND SHE ALREADY HAS HER TREASURE IT'S YOU
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
HE WAS OLDER AND CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
WHAT'S DANCE
HE TOOK THE FOURTH PART AND HANTED IT TO DE MONK
BETWEEN ROAST BEEF AND POTATOES HOW CAN WE LOSE
IT WAS A COBERE WHOSE VENOM COULD KILL A PERSON IN MINUTES
I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE ANAWA
WHENEVER HE SAW THE SEA OR A FIRE HE FELL SILENT IMPRESSED BY THEIR ELEMENTAL FORCE
HOWDO YOU HAPPEN TO FALL IN
THE OMENS WILL BEGIN INSISTENTLY TO SPEAK OF IT AND YOU WILL TRY TO IGNORE THEM
THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
I FIND THE OTHER ARGUMENT DUBIOUS
THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME
BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
YET EACH FELT HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER
IM IT DOTH BEAUTIFUL
THEY WERE MEN OF A DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
HE SAT LOOKING AT DUSKAI FOR A WRONG TIME
A FIFTH CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
I DON'T LIKE COCOANUTS
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
THEN THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO INSPECT THE SHEEP AND HE SAW THAT ONE WAS LAME
AN ASAY MAYBE YOU BO FAVID
I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE MINE
THERE WASN'T MUCH IMPETUS TO FINISH OUR CHARES
HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT
MY MOTHER JUST CALLED YOU
THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOME DAY THE GIRL SAID
H FEMEL IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE BOUGHT TICKETS TO AFRICA
DROP THE WHOLE BUSINESS QUICKLY
HE JUST CALLED A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTDAY
THESE HATPHOMS PLAYED MUSIC VERY CLEARLY IN MY EARS
I'VE JUST SWORN IN FOUR HUNDRED DEPUTIES
I AM GOING INTO THE DESERT MAN ANSET TURNING BACK TO HIS READING
THAT'S WHAT I DID BEFORE I MARRIED CHARLES
THE DRIVER GOT KNOCKED COLD
ETSE OISSIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
THE LETTER AIN'T WORTH NOTHING
WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSOL THE ARRAS ASK
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
I'D BETTER SEE WHAT HE IS UP TO
A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS
THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE
STILL AFTER THAT FIRST MILLION BEFORE YOU ARE THORT IT
THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
TO DAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
WHO DO YOU WANT
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAKE TO MY WEAT
AND FINALLY THE FALCAN RETURNED WITH THEM EL
LATS OF PLACES SELL SEA AROUND HERE THE MERCHANT SAID
HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TERIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH HA RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TE BIRDS
DOT BE IMPATIENT HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF
BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE DIDN'T WANT TO MISS T ON AN OPPORTUNITY
AT THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER
THIS COM BE STRENCED ENOUGH I AM INNOCENT HE CRIED DESPERATELY
I WANT A FLOWER
THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING SITUATION
TISCOP IS MADE OF POLIS STEREM
THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
WE'LL LEAVE TO MORROW BEFORE SUNRISE WAS THE ALCHYMUST'S ONLY RESPONSE
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
MY FATHER NOW CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
AN WHAT DO YOU DOIN SALEM HE INSISTED
YO THEY MIGHT EVEN THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOVED RAW O CONVERSATION NO
LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LOVE OR FINDING THE JOB
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU
HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER
BUT MAYBE I NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
FINODETT AND PIARIOSTRIT
YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
AS HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO PULL OUT THE ROCKS HE ENCOUNTERED HE HEARD FOOTSTEPS
HE'S ON THE WAY
I NEVER KNEW HE HAD A DIER
AND TO MORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE PART OF BOD SOUL
I' BEEN STRY THE FIGUR UH
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR HORROR
THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMMEN SCARRIED THROUGHOUD THE BOUNGRIES AT ALPARN
AND HE CAME DOWN AFTER THE GAME WITH THE CONTRACT
ID YOU ACTUALLY GIVE TO MORRA THAT GUN
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED
THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT PRETTY FEW PEOPLEMEN BOAT
WHEN YOU FIND A BOCK IN SOFTWARE PLEASE REPORT IT
IT SEEMS SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
THANKS FOR DROPPING AROUND
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE WERE LIKE THAT
I BEG OF YOU NOTH TO DO THIS SONG
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SHAME YOG AND HE WALKED INTO POLISE OFFICE
THE CHARCOAL BURNT AWAY TO WHITE ASH
HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK DREVE FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
STILL I'VE NO IDEA HOW TO TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY REPEATED
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
BUT THE BOY SAT DOWN AND WAITED
AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER MITROID HAD DESCENDED
WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIPAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HALL
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
THEY PLANCED IT IN A WOODEN BOX AND LEFT IT THERE FOR GOOD
YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF FRANCE LEADING I TO THE HOUSE
YOUR HUSBAND MUST HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT HURRY
THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
TO SHOW YOU ONE OF LIFE'S IMPLE LESSONS THE ALCHINIST ANSWERED
THE PASHAN WAS SOFT AND INWITENING
SHE PLACED OLEM AND TOMMEM IN THE CHEST
I DONE MY BEST
SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
JUPITER HAS A GREAT RED SPOT
NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
AND GOT IT OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN
I'LL NEVER GET THIS SPEECH RIGHT
THERE WAS A FOURTH FIRE IN LOS ANGELES
I'S NOT A REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULD
ABOUT ELEVEN I WOKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
THANK YOU SAID THE BOY
IS THE HEAD BETTER
HOW COULD IT BE OLQUED
HE RAN HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE STONES SENSING THEIR TEMPERATURE AND FEELING THEIR SURFACES
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE WOULD BE OF A SUCH IMPORTANCE TO A SHEPHERD
MY DROB REQUIRES A LOT OF CRAVELLING
BUT YOU DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RAGNOW
HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALESMAN AGAIN
I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES A YEAR THIS HAPPENS
I ENCOURAGE EVERY ONE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR VOICE TO PROJECT COMMON VOICE
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE SHEEP ARE AFRAID OF STRANGERS
A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN IN THE SHOP
I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
I'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I HAVE SOMETHING
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
HE'S INSANE OR DRUNK OR SOMETHING
WEL I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
YOU CARLED THE TAMBER NOT TEN MINUTES AGO
THE OLD MAN GAVE A SIGNAL AND EVERYONE STOO
THE GREATEST AUTHORITY OF METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO
DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE
AND I AM SERRYTO YOU WILL FIND IT THE ARCHIMIS SAID
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE THAT AND YOU'LL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS COUNSELLOR
LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWORD WITH ITS TRANSPARENT CLASK HIDDEN ON TOP
I DIDN'T FALL IN
CAN I AT LEAST KEEP THE ONION SOUP
HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
THERE WAS A THUD LIKE THE FALL OF A GREAT MASS
AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
WHO DO YOU FEEL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
IT WAS A FATO JEC FLYING BETWEEN THE BOLDENS
KEEP HIS SHIRT ON
THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGED TO GET HIM OUT OF THE POCK
SOMEBODY PUSHED AGAINST ME AND I ALMOST FELL INTO THE DITCH
SO WHAT IS SALUM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
FROM THEN ON THE BOY UNDERSTOOD HIS HEART
THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE SIGN AT ERS TOO LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
MY FATHER FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
I COULDN'T WORK IN THE CITY
HE JUST TOOK OVER THE BANK
THE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXALTED
THERE MUST BE A LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T DEPEND ON WORDS THE BOY THOUGHT
THE AUTOR'S ATTENTIVE FACIAL EXPRESSION WAS CONVINCING THE JURY
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME WAN THE CLOUD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
BY INIMERATINGS OF PEOPLE SHE WANTED TO TALK WITH SHE WAS CALMED
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHYMUS TENT WITH THE HORSE
AND GOT IT OUT AS SOON AS HE CAN
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
THE BOY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT WHEN HE RETURNED FROM EGYPT HE WOULD BUY THAT SWORD
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WARD OF MOTH HE THOUGHT
AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
IN ANY CASE IT'S GOODFORT YOU'VE LEARNT THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
BUT PICKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERD
BUT YOU WILL LOVE HER AND SHE'LL RETURN YOUR LOVE
IT SHOULD PROVIDE RESULTS COMPARABLE TO THE STATE OF THE ART
THERE WAS NO NEED TO INQREASON THEN THE ARABIS SIMPLY CONFISCATED THE HORACES
WHAT WE NEED IS FIREWORKS
CAN I GO NOW
TWINS ARE KNOWN TO BE CONFOUNDING
IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
AS JENEFER WALKED DOWN THE AISLE SHE WONDERED IF SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AROUND HERE
I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TIPPED TO MY WEE
THE BOY'S NAME WAS FANTIABBLE
WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
O THIS HEATING BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
OF COURSE IT IS
AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS
DO IT FOR THE PAPER
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO LIT THE BALL
I CAN ALWAYS GO ABACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
IT RATTLED MENACINGLY
THE OLD MAN LEAPED THROUGH THE BROOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
I STILL SAY THAT THIS DRONDO PERSON IS A MUTH
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLEN OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE DURING THE BLACKMITH WITH PATCHES OF GUINO CREAMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED
HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T
NOT UNTIL THE MOON WAS HIGH DID THE ALCHEMIST RIDE INTO VIEW
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON WHY SHE WAS KILLED
BUY TACKS DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PRONGS
THE WEATHER FORECAST FOR THIS WEEK DIDN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL
YOU HAVE HELPED ME THE MAN CONTINUED TO PREPARE HIS TEA SAYING NOTHING
TO DAY'S WORLD IS FULL OF COMMERCIALS
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
THE FIRST RULER DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE IMONDS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
A LITTLE LEMON GRASS SHOULD FRESHEN IT UP
AS WAS MECCA FOR THE MERCHANT
THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE BOUGHT TICKETS TO AFRICA
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ONE OF THE FIGURES DEMANDED
